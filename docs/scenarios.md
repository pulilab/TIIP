# Scenarios
The Scenarios View describes Use Cases and their corresponding scripts (sequences of interactions). To some extent, use cases form an alternative view of the most important requirements. Together with their scripts they drive subsequent discovery of architectural elements, serve as a material for architecture validation and constitute a starting point for test scripts preparation.
